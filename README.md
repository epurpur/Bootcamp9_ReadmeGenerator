# README Generator

My task is to create a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer). When running the program in Node.js, the user's information is collected and added to the markdown document.

## Walkthrough video

I was not able to use Screencastify to record my video walkthrough so I used Zoom's screen recording feature instead. 
View the video walkthrough here:

Passcode: R73nzj*z

## Result

Below is an example of the result when running the program.
